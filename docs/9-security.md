# Security Improvements

## Exposing KubeAPI via Load Balancer:

**Risk**: Exposing the KubeAPI through a public load balancer, even if restricted to your IP, can still be a potential attack vector. This setup might be vulnerable if your IP changes or if the load balancer itself is compromised.

**Mitigation**:
- **Use a Bastion Host**: Consider setting up a bastion host that you SSH into first, and then access the control plane via its private IP. This avoids exposing the KubeAPI on the public internet.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: If your infrastructure supports it, enable 2FA for SSH connections to add an extra layer of security.
- **Limit IP Range**: Ensure the `var.my_public_ip_cidr` is as restrictive as possible (e.g., `x.x.x.x/32` for a single IP).

## Audit and Logging:

- **Ensure logging**: Make sure that all access to the load balancer and the KubeAPI is logged for auditing purposes. OCI services typically have logging capabilities, so enable these to monitor for any suspicious activity.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Implementing intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) can further secure the control plane by monitoring for abnormal activities.

## Security List for SSH:

**Risk**: Your security list rule allows SSH from `0.0.0.0/0`, which exposes SSH to the entire internet.

**Mitigation**: Restrict this rule to allow SSH only from specific IP addresses (e.g., your home or office IP). Alternatively, use the load balancer to control SSH access as you are doing, and restrict direct SSH access to the nodes.

## Encryption and TLS:

- Ensure that all communication, especially through the KubeAPI and load balancer, is encrypted with TLS. Configure SSL/TLS certificates for the load balancer to secure the HTTPS traffic.

## Network Segmentation:

- **Internal Load Balancer**: If possible, consider using an internal load balancer instead of a public one, and access the control plane through a secure tunnel (e.g., VPN or bastion host). This reduces the attack surface.
