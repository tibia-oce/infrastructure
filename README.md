# 🏠 Oracle K3S Cluster

This mono-repository demonstrates how to deploy a K3s Kubernetes cluster for free on Oracle [always free resources](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm).  Infrastructure provisioning, configuration and deployments are managed with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps; using toolings from [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm), [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/), [ArgoCD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

<br>

## ⛵ Features

### GitOps

[Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) monitors the repository's Kubernetes manifests and ensures the cluster matches the desired state in Git. When changes are merged, Argo CD automatically applies them to the cluster.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches for dependency updates, creating pull requests when updates are found. Once merged, Argo CD detects and applies the changes, deploying the updated dependencies.

### State Management
[Terraform Cloud](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) handles the locking and consistency of state files, which helps prevent issues that might arise from multiple users or processes trying to modify the state simultaneously.

### Secret Management

[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) stores and manages secrets, passwords, and API keys. It controls access, provides dynamic secrets, and supports automatic rotation to enhance security and limit exposure.

### Core Components

- [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/application-services/products/dns/): dns resolution for layer 4 and layer 7 cluster applications.
- [metal-lb](https://metallb.universe.tf/): layer 2 & 3 network load balancing to integrate with Oracle cloud without a CCM.
- [nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/): an os-level pass through proxy to support cloud integration.
- [flannel](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel): internal Kubernetes container networking interface.
- [traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/): as a reverse proxy and service load balancing ingress controller.
- [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager): manages SSL certificates for services in the cluster.
- [gatus](https://gatus.io/): monitors the health and performance of services, with alerts.
- [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared): enables zero-trust tunnelling to certain ingress routes.

## 🌐 Network topology

Here's a macroscopic overview of the state of the network, integrated with Oracle ingress points.

## 🔧 Requirements

> [!NOTE]
>
> This repository is for demonstration only and not recommended for production. It uses [OCI always-free](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm), re-claimable compute instances, which after the 30-day trial, OCI may stop, hibernate, or terminate.

To use this repo you will need:

* an Oracle Cloud account.
* a HCP Vault account.
* a HCP Terraform account.
* a HCP Service Principal.
